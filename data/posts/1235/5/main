Confucius said, "To have the occasion to practice what you have studied, is it not a pleasure? To have old friends come from a far, is it not a joy? When one is patient even when others do not understand, is one not a gentleman?<br><br>Laozi said, "The Way that can be spoken of is not the constant way. The Name that can be named is not the constant name. Nameless, it is the basis of earth and heaven. Named, it is the mother of the ten thousand things. This is a fundamental mystery."
